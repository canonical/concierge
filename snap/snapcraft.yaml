summary: A utility for configuring dev/test machines for charm development
description: |
  concierge is an opinionated utility for provisioning charm development and testing machines.

  It's role is to ensure that a given machine has the relevant "craft" tools and providers installed,
  then bootstrap a Juju controller onto each of the providers. Additionally, it can install selected
  tools from the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io) or the Ubuntu archive.

  Configuration is by flags/environment variables, or by configuration file. The configuration file
  must be in the current working directory and named 'concierge.yaml', or the path specified using
  the '-c' flag.

  There are 3 presets available by default: 'machine', 'k8s' and 'dev'.

  Some aspects of presets and config files can be overridden using flags such as '--juju-channel'.
  Each of the override flags has an environment variable equivalent, such as 'CONCIERGE_JUJU_CHANNEL'.
